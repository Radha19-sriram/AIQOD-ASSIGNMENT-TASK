**Text Classification Model Project**
**Domain Introduction**
The project focuses on building a text classification model using machine learning algorithms to predict the categories of text data.

**Problem Statement**
The project aims to build a text classification model that can accurately predict the categories of text data based on its content.

**Project Structure**
train.csv: Training data file.
trainLabels.csv: Training labels file.
test.csv: Test data file.
submission.csv: Final submission file.
script.py: Main script containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, and prediction.
README.md: Documentation file.

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
Data cleaning and preprocessing involve handling null values, combining text columns, removing missing values, and converting labels to numeric type for model compatibility.

**EDA Findings**
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) reveals insights into the distribution of text data across different categories and helps identify patterns in the data. The analysis shows a balanced distribution of text data among different categories, with no significant class imbalances.

**Feature Engineering**
Feature engineering techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization are used to convert text data into numerical features for model building. TF-IDF vectorization is applied to the combined text data to transform it into a format suitable for machine learning models.

**Model Building**
A logistic regression model is chosen as the base model for its simplicity and effectiveness in handling multi-class classification tasks. The model is trained using the TF-IDF transformed text data and the multi-output logistic regression classifier.

**Model Selection and Evaluation**
The model is selected based on its performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the validation dataset. The model is evaluated using the F1-score as it provides a balance between precision and recall for multi-class classification tasks.

**Conclusion**
The key findings of the project include the successful development of a text classification model using logistic regression and TF-IDF vectorization.

**Business Suggestion/Solution**
The developed model can be used to automatically classify text data, enabling faster and more accurate categorization of textual information.
